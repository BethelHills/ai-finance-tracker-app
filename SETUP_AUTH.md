# Authentication Setup Guide

## Current Status

The application is currently using fallback authentication because Supabase is not configured. This is working fine for development and testing purposes.

## To Enable Supabase Authentication

1. **Create a Supabase Project**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Note down your project URL and anon key

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   - Run the SQL schema from `supabase-schema-enhanced.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
   - This will create the necessary tables for the application

## Fallback Authentication

The application automatically falls back to a local authentication system when Supabase is not configured. This allows you to:

- Test the application without setting up Supabase
- Develop features without external dependencies
- Demo the application easily

## Features Working with Fallback Auth

- ✅ User signup
- ✅ User signin
- ✅ User session management
- ✅ Protected routes
- ✅ User profile management

## Next Steps

1. The signup flow should now work properly
2. Users will be automatically signed in after successful signup
3. The application will redirect to the dashboard
4. All authentication features work with the fallback system

## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Ensure the application is running on `http://localhost:3000`
3. Clear browser cache and try again
4. Check that all required components are properly imported
