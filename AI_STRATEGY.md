- **Confidence Scoring**: Provide confidence levels for categorization decisions
- **Learning from Corrections**: Improve accuracy based on user feedback

**Technical Approach**:

```typescript
// AI categorizes transactions with confidence scoring
const categorization = await AIService.categorizeTransaction(
  'Starbucks Coffee #1234',
  -4.5
);
// Returns: { category: "Food", confidence: 0.95, tags: ["coffee", "dining"] }
```

### 2. Intelligent Data Processing

**Purpose**: Automate data cleaning, validation, and enrichment

**Implementation**:

- **Data Validation**: AI validates transaction data for accuracy
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies and flags potential duplicate transactions
- **Data Enrichment**: Adds missing information (merchant details, location, etc.)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags unusual transactions for review

### 3. Smart User Interface

**Purpose**: Use AI to personalize and optimize the user experience

**Implementation**:

- **Dynamic Dashboard**: AI customizes dashboard based on user behavior
- **Intelligent Notifications**: Sends relevant alerts at optimal times
- **Personalized Insights**: Shows insights most relevant to user's financial situation
- **Adaptive UI**: Adjusts interface based on user preferences and usage patterns
