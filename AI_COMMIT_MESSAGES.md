# üìù AI-Generated Commit Messages

## Evidence of AI-Assisted Commit Message Generation

This document demonstrates how AI was used to generate professional, descriptive commit messages throughout the development process, following conventional commit standards.

---

## ü§ñ **AI Commit Message Generation Process**

### **Prompt Used for Commit Message Generation**
```
Generate a professional commit message for the following changes:
- [List of changes made]
- [Files modified]
- [Features added/removed]
- [Bug fixes]
- [Breaking changes]

Follow conventional commit format:
- feat: for new features
- fix: for bug fixes
- docs: for documentation changes
- style: for formatting changes
- refactor: for code refactoring
- test: for adding tests
- chore: for maintenance tasks

Include:
- Clear, descriptive summary (50 chars max)
- Detailed description of changes
- Breaking changes if any
- Related issues if applicable
```
