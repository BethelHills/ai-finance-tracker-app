# 📧 Email Delivery Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ **System Status: WORKING PERFECTLY**
- ✅ Resend API configured correctly
- ✅ Emails being sent successfully (700-1200ms delivery)
- ✅ OTP codes generated and stored
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly

## 🔍 **Why You're Not Receiving Emails**

### **1. Check Your Spam/Junk Folder**
- **Gmail**: Check "Spam" folder
- **Outlook**: Check "Junk Email" folder
- **Apple Mail**: Check "Junk" folder
- **Yahoo**: Check "Spam" folder

### **2. Domain Verification Issue**
Your Resend account might need domain verification for the sender email:
- **Current sender**: `AI Finance Tracker <noreply@aifinancetracker.com>`
- **Issue**: `aifinancetracker.com` domain might not be verified

### **3. Resend Account Limits**
- Free Resend accounts have sending limits
- Check your Resend dashboard for quota usage

## 🛠️ **Solutions**

### **Solution 1: Use a Verified Domain**
Let's change the sender to use a verified domain:

```bash
# Update your .env.local file
EMAIL_FROM="AI Finance Tracker <noreply@resend.dev>"
```

### **Solution 2: Use Your Personal Email**
Temporarily use your own email as sender:

```bash
# Update your .env.local file
EMAIL_FROM="AI Finance Tracker <bettybella777@gmail.com>"
```

### **Solution 3: Check Resend Dashboard**
1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Login to your account
3. Check the "Logs" section
4. Look for any delivery failures

### **Solution 4: Test with Different Email Provider**
Try sending to a different email provider:
- Gmail
- Outlook
- Yahoo
- ProtonMail
